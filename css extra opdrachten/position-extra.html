                Elon Musk is my idol. I aspire to be like him. But it's only fair to mention that he was gifted a circle
                of
                influence being born to a prominent jeweler. Selling a good idea is just as hard as building it in my
                opinion. You have to find a buyer willing to pay what it's worth and if you don't know people with money
                to
                sell to then you also have to recognize when someone is trying to low-ball you for a good idea. The
                point
                remains, I want to create change and learn to find investors just like Elon. He really is one of
                history's
                greats.

            <p>
                I have had a plethora of talks with my grandfather before about the future of humanity and all of these
                ideas. Funnily enough, my family thinks he's off put on the guy standing next to him. I simply think
                that he
                has too much time on his hands to actively do stuff. But over my Christmas break, we had gotten him a
                book.
                A book simply entitled “Elon Musk”. During the usual Sunday phone call, he had praised how he had seen
                Elon
                Musk as one of his heroes who was at the forefront of humanity, doing all of this wicked technology
                breakthroughs. I often call him out with discretion on the fact that not everything today is technology
                and
                science. Though as I am writing this paper, he is right, Elon Musk can be truly seen as a hero. Although
                I
                may be delving into the humanities. I must acknowledge that Elon Musk is truly a hero in the sciences
                and me
                more than respect him for that to the point where I can somewhat call him “my hero” in regards to
                science
                and technology. I can confidently say this for he is astute, supportive of the future, and has a sense
                of
                humor.
            </p>

            <p>
                To say that Elon Musk is rather smart would be doing a disservice to him. He is possibly one the
                smartest
                men in the world. To name perhaps one of his greatest successes as an inventor is that he is the chief
                engineer of SpaceX, the space company earlier mentioned. To be the chief engineer and founder of the
                company
                that is changing space travel surely signifies him as a man who clearly knows what and why he is doing
                what
                he does. It is this intelligence and prowess in the field of science that makes him a hero in my eyes.
                Somebody who is good at something can be seen as a hero in our lives. Somebody who can ignite the spark
                of
                change for good and the betterment of humanity can also be seen as a hero. It is these two abilities
                that
                are transparent in Elon Musk that truly make him a hero to me.
            </p>
