                Tell me. For whom do you fight?

                Hmph! How very glib. And do you believe in Eorzea? Eorzea's unity is forged of falsehoods. Its
                city-states are built on deceit. And its faith is an instrument of deception.

                It is naught but a cobweb of lies. To believe in Eorzea is to believe in nothing. In Eorzea, the beast
                tribes often summon gods to fight in their stead--though your comrades only rarely respond in kind.
                Which is strange, is it not?

                Are the "Twelve" otherwise engaged? I was given to understand they were your protectors. If you truly
                believe them your guardians, why do you not repeat the trick that served you so well at Carteneau, and
                call them down? They will answer--so long as you lavish them with crystals and gorge them on aether.
                Your gods are no different than those of the beasts--eikons every one. Accept but this, and you will see
                how Eorzea's faith is bleeding the land dry.
